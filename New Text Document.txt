Difference between C/C++ and python 
Feature	C	Python
Language Level	Low-level (closer to Hardware)	High-level ( close to  human language)
Syntax Style	Verbose and strict 	Simple and readable
Compilation	Compiled	Interpreted
Memory Management		
Speed	Faster	Slower
Syntax	Complex, verbose	Simple, readable
Memory Management	Manual	Automatic
Application Domains	Systems programming	General-purpose, high-level apps
Learning Curve	Steeper	Easier



Mid term question paper

	1. Name 5 componenst of computer?
    3. Name 4 inbuild python functions?
     3. what is type casting in python and explain with one example?
     4. Create a infinite loop in python using loop function( pseduo code)
	5. Write pesudo code to swap Two Numbers using Temporary Variable
	Ex: a=3, b=4, the program should return a=4 and b=3
	
	
	
	 2*10 ( answe any two questions)
	1st question
1. Name 5 diffrence in features of  between C and python ?
Exaplin each item and its syntax and declare and example with its syntax
	1. Numeric data type ( int , float)
	2. strings
	3. Lists
	4. Tuples
	5. Dictionary
Question 2
2.  Wirte algorithm and flow chart find the smallest of two numbers
 2nd question
Write algorithm and flow chart to find sum of series 1+2+3+…..up to N 

	
	Note: pesudo code here meant is here just steps and idea ypu use syntax may maynot be correct 
	Example for pesudo code
